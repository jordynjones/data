A: Risk-neutral investors judge risky prospects solely by their expected rates of return. 
Q: What do risk lovers engage in?
A:  A risk lover is willing to engage in fair games and gambles; this investor adjusts the expected return upward to take into account the “fun” of confronting the prospect’s risk.
